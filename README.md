Machine learning related code

I learned how to code machine learning with the help of the book "Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles" by Seth Weidman. Most of the actual machine learning code is from the book, but I learned how and why the algorithms work. Code from the book and code created independently will be indicated.
